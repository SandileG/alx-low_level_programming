Macros and Their Use: Macros in C are symbolic names representing code fragments. They are created using #define and help in code reuse and simplification by replacing specific code with these names.

Common Predefined Macros: C provides predefined macros like __FILE__ (current file name), __LINE__ (current line number), and __cplusplus (if C++ compiler) to access information about the code during compilation.

Header File Include Guarding: Include guards are preprocessor directives (#ifndef, #define, #endif) used to prevent header files from being included multiple times in the same source code, avoiding compilation errors and improving code efficiency.

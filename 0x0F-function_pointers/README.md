Function Pointers:

What are function pointers and how to use them: 

Function pointers are pointers in programming languages, such as C and C++, that store the memory addresses of functions rather than data. They are used to invoke functions indirectly through the pointer. Function pointers are versatile and allow for dynamic function calls, making them useful in scenarios like callback functions, implementing function tables, and creating extensible code. To use function pointers, you typically declare a pointer to a function with the correct function signature and then assign it the address of a compatible function. You can call the function indirectly through the pointer by dereferencing it with the * operator and providing arguments as needed.

What does a function pointer exactly hold: 

A function pointer holds the memory address of a function's entry point in the program's code segment. It points to the starting address of the executable code of the function. Unlike regular data pointers, function pointers do not point to data; instead, they reference the instructions to execute a function. The pointer contains the specific location in memory where the function's code resides.

Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory:

Function pointers point to the virtual memory address space where the code of the function is loaded. In a virtual memory system, this address is a logical or virtual address. The operating system is responsible for managing the mapping of virtual addresses to physical memory locations, which may involve techniques like paging or segmentation. Function pointers work with virtual memory addresses, allowing programs to call functions regardless of their actual physical memory location. This indirection provided by virtual memory enables efficient memory management and multitasking in modern computer systems.

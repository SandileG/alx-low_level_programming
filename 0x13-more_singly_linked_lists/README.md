A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element has a reference to the next element in the sequence. To use a linked list, you typically define a structure for each element, also known as a node, which contains the data and a pointer to the next node. 

To utilize a linked list effectively, you need to understand and implement the basic operations, which include insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. When using a linked list, you should pay attention to properly handling the pointers to maintain the integrity of the list.

Additionally, it's important to consider the time complexity of various operations, as inserting or deleting an element in the middle of a linked list can be less efficient compared to similar operations in other data structures like arrays. However, linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation and efficient element insertion and deletion at the beginning.

Understanding these basics can provide a solid foundation for effectively using linked lists in various applications and programming tasks.

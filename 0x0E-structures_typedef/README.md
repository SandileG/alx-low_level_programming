Structures:

Structures in C are user-defined data types that allow you to group multiple variables of different data types into a single unit. They are used to represent a collection of related data, making it easier to organize and manipulate data in your programs. You can use structures when you need to store and access different types of data associated with a single entity or object, like representing a person with attributes such as name, age, and address.

Typedef:

Typedef is a C keyword used to create aliases or alternative names for existing data types. It allows you to define custom names for data types to make your code more readable and easier to maintain. Typedef is commonly used when you want to create shorter, more descriptive names for complex or user-defined data types, such as structures or function pointers. It simplifies code and improves code readability by providing meaningful names for data types, making it easier to understand the purpose of variables and function signatures.

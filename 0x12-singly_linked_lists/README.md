When and why to use linked lists vs arrays:

Arrays:

Arrays are useful when the size of the data is known and doesn't change frequently.
They offer fast access to elements by index.
Memory is allocated in a contiguous block, allowing efficient memory access.
Linked Lists:

Linked lists are preferable when the size of the data is dynamic and may change frequently.
They provide efficient insertion and deletion of elements, even in the middle of the list.
Memory allocation is flexible, as nodes can be scattered throughout memory.
They are useful when the order of elements matters less than the ability to add and remove elements efficiently.
How to build and use linked lists:

To build and use a linked list, you typically follow these steps:

Define a node structure containing data and a pointer to the next node.
Initialize a pointer to the head of the linked list.
Implement functions for creating a new node, adding a node at the beginning or end of the list, and removing a node.
Use these functions to manipulate the linked list, such as inserting new elements, removing elements, and traversing the list to perform operations or access data.
Handle special cases, such as adding or removing the first or last element, to ensure proper functioning of the linked list.
Linked lists can be used for various applications such as implementing stacks, queues, and graphs, as well as managing dynamic data where frequent insertions and deletions are required.

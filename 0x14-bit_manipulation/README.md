Bit manipulation involves the use of bitwise operators to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. By using bitwise operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift, you can perform various tasks such as setting or clearing bits, checking if a particular bit is set, or extracting specific bits from a number.

Here are some common bitwise operators:

1. AND (&): Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
2. OR (|): Sets each bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1.
3. XOR (^): Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1.
4. NOT (~): Inverts all the bits.
5. Left shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left, discarding the bits shifted off.
6. Right shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right, discarding the bits shifted off.

Bit manipulation is often used in low-level programming, embedded systems, and tasks that require memory or performance optimizations. Understanding how to use these operators effectively can significantly improve the efficiency and speed of certain operations within your code.

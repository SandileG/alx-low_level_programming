Variadic Functions:

Variadic functions in C are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. They are declared with an ellipsis (...) in the argument list. Common examples include printf and scanf. You can use the <stdarg.h> library to work with variable arguments.

va_start, va_arg, and va_end Macros:

va_start: Initializes a va_list object to point to the first variable argument.
va_arg: Retrieves the next argument of a specified type from the va_list.
va_end: Cleans up and invalidates the va_list when you're done with variable arguments. It must be called after all va_arg calls.

Const Type Qualifier:

const is used to declare that a variable's value cannot be modified after it's initialized. It's a way to enforce immutability.
When applied to a pointer, it means the data pointed to by the pointer is constant, so you can't modify it through that pointer.
Const-correctness helps catch programming errors, improves code readability, and allows for compiler optimizations by indicating the intent not to modify data.

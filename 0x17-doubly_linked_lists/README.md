# Doubly Linked Lists


# Doubly Linked List:

A doubly linked list is a linear data structure in which elements, called nodes, are connected in a sequential manner. Each node contains data and two pointers, one pointing to the next node in the sequence (next pointer), and another pointing to the previous node (previous pointer). Unlike singly linked lists, where each node only points to the next node, doubly linked lists allow for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions.

# Using Doubly Linked Lists:

Doubly linked lists are utilized in scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion operations are expected, as their structure allows for straightforward manipulation of elements in both directions. Common use cases include implementing undo functionality in applications, maintaining a dynamic data structure with constant-time insertions and deletions, and facilitating bidirectional traversal in data processing tasks.

# Implementation of Operations:

# Insertion:

Adding a node at the beginning involves updating the next pointer of the new node, the previous pointer of the existing first node, and the head pointer.
Inserting in the middle requires adjusting next and previous pointers of neighboring nodes.
Inserting at the end involves updating pointers of the new node, the current last node, and the tail pointer.

# Deletion:

Removing a node from the beginning involves updating pointers of the second node and the head pointer.
Deleting from the middle requires adjusting next and previous pointers of neighboring nodes.
Removing the last node involves updating pointers of the previous node and the tail pointer.

# Traversal:

Forward traversal starts from the head and follows next pointers until the end.
Backward traversal starts from the tail and follows previous pointers until the beginning.
